# IDS (Intrusion Detection System)


## Overview

IDS is a comprehensive intrusion detection system designed to monitor network traffic and system activities for malicious actions or security policy violations. This project combines signature-based and anomaly-based detection methods to provide robust security monitoring capabilities.

## Features

- **Real-time Network Monitoring**: Analyze network packets and traffic patterns in real-time
- **Signature-based Detection**: Identify known attack patterns and vulnerabilities
- **Anomaly-based Detection**: Detect unusual behavior that deviates from normal activity
- **Alert System**: Instant notifications for potential security threats
- **Dashboard Interface**: Visualization of security events and network activities
- **Log Analysis**: Advanced parsing and correlation of system logs
- **Automated Response Options**: Configure automatic actions when threats are detected
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle enterprise-level traffic volumes

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Linux/Unix environment (recommended)
- Network interface in promiscuous mode
- Administrative/root privileges

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sharjeel-siddiqui12/Intrusion-detection-system-using-MBGWO-and-Random-Forest-TON_IoT_dataset.git
cd Intrusion-detection-system-using-MBGWO-and-Random-Forest-TON_IoT_dataset

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure the system
cp config.example.yml config.yml
nano config.yml

# Run the setup script
./setup.sh
```

## Usage

Start the IDS service:

```bash
sudo python3 ids_main.py
```

Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:8080` (default)

## Configuration

The system can be configured by editing the `config.yml` file. Key configuration options include:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `network.interface` | Network interface to monitor | eth0 |
| `detection.sensitivity` | Detection sensitivity level | medium |
| `alerts.email` | Email for receiving alerts | admin@example.com |
